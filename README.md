#TextProgressBar
This is a simple implemention of a progress bar which shows itself as text.
You can change text size, fill and stroke color, skew and alignment. Font changing will be implemented shortly.

The easiest way to import this is to download the .jar file and put it in your project in the __libs__ folder, and then right click on the .jar and select add to build path.

All properties of the view must be changed in code, you cannot change any of the custom parametrs inside of the xml, but you can change everything like a regular ProgressBar. Make sure to set the style of the progress bar as `style="@android:style/Widget.ProgressBar.Horizontal"`
